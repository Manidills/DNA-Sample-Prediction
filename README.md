# DNA-Sample-Prediction

While checking the DNA data its looks different then the normal data, words are present in some type of pattern. Then i came to know we need to arrage these data for good prediction.

K-MER-

A kmer is just a nucleotide sequence of a certain length. For instance a dinucleotide is a kmer where k=2.

When we talk about all kmers to talk about all the possible sequences of that length. So for example, when K=2 all the possible kmers are: AA AT AC AG TA TT TC TG CA CT CC CG GA GT GC GG

K is usually bigger than 2, so we can talk about all 4mers (256 of them), all 6mers (4096 of them), all 7mers (16,384 of them)


Kmer is good method to use for DNA data, seemed many research camed with Kmer is well known for DNA datasets. With kmer and pystacknet we camed with good prediction.
